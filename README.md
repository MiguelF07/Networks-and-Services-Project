# Networks-and-Services-Project
This project was developed in the context of [Networks and Services](https://www.ua.pt/en/uc/14818) curricular unit, part of the Computer Science Bachelor at [Aveiro University](https://www.ua.pt/). It was lectured by [António Manuel Duarte Nogueira](https://www.ua.pt/en/p/10317117) during the 2020/2021 school year.

It was graded **19,7 out of 20**

## About the project

We were asked to build an enterprise network, respecting the IP pool that was given. We had to make sure the IP addresses were well distributed and that we had connection with every part of the network.

We implemented protocols like RIP, OSPF, BGP, NAT/PAT and IPSec Tunnel.

## Technology stack

For this project, we used GNS3, a graphical network simulator that allowed us to simulate our network connections.
